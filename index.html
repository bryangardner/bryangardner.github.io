<p>I am a computer science student at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing Bachelors and Masters degrees in computer science at Stevens, and I am expected to graduate in May 2018.<br>
During my time at Stevens, I have been participating in the cooperative education program to gain professional experience in my field while pursuing my degree. I have held the following positions:
1. Network Analyst at Nomura Americas (Jan 2015 - May 2015)
2. Systems Engineer at Volant Trading (Aug 2015 - Dec 2015)
3. Software Developer at iCIMS (June 2016 - Aug 2016)
For my final cooperative education assignment, I will be returning to Nomura Americas from (Jan 2017 - Aug 2017).</p>
